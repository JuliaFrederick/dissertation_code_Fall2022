This is a repository of the code used in the disseration "WHAT MAKES IXODES SCAPULARIS TICK: POPULATION GENOMICS AND SEX DIFFERENCES OF THE BLACKLEGGED TICK" by Julia Catherine Frederick 

All sequencing data is available in the following repositories and will be released at time of journal publication.

Genetic data:
Raw sequence reads for the 3RAD data are deposited in the SRA (BioProject PRJNA852262)
Raw sequence reads for the resequencing data are deposited in the SRA (BioProject PRJNA853920)
Sample metadata:
Metadata are also stored in the SRA (BioProject PRJNA852262) for the 3RAD data using the invertebrate v1.0 package 
Metadata are also stored in the SRA (BioProject PRJNA853920) for the resequencing data using the invertebrate v1.0 package
